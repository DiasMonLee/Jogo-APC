# Window Invaders

Game made in Python using the Pygame library. The game was originally
a project from a CS class "algorithm and computer programming", but
after the class ended, I decided to make a whole game out the simple
first version.

# How to run

To run the game, open the computer terminal (cmd for windows),
go to the game file directory using 'cd [file destination]'
and, with python installed, run the commmand 'python.exe window_invaders.py'
Have fun!
