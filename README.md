# Window Invaders

Game made in Python using the Pygame library. The game was originally
a project from a CS class "algorithm and computer programming", but
after the class ended, I decided to make a whole game out the simple
first version.

# How to run

To open the game, simply run the "WindowsInvaders.exe" file
and wait for the game to open and Have fun.
The rules are all written inside the game, so there shouldn't
be any problems undersating how to play. It's basically 
Space Invaders but kinda different.
Enjoy!
